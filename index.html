      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        There are many things that I value most in my life, such as culture and education.
        Yet it is technology and computer science which has fueled my overarching ambitions to
        pursue computing as a future career.

          <h3>Love - Computing</h3>
          <p>
            I first fell in love with computing when I drew a version of the cartoon Mickey Mouse
            with Visual Basic in middle school. Since then, I have dedicated myself to acquiring
            relevant education and work experience to grow my skills and knowledge in this field.

          <h3>Passion - Education</h3>
          <p>
            My other passion lies in education. I enjoy the feeling of helping others since I was in
            primary school, which is why I volunteered to teach Cantonese every week during high
            school. Now I became a curriculum developer in Girl Coders, an organization which aims
            to attract more women to be interested in STEM-related fields.

          <h3>Root - Culture</h3>
          <p>I believe my international education in China, Canada, and the US has broadened my
            global perspective and strengthened the respect I have for my own culture. Furthermore,
            embracing other cultures has enriched my life a lot.</p>

          <h3>Lifetime Goal</h3>
          <p>
            These experiences in the spheres of education, culture, and working with other
            communities abroad has brought me great joy and satisfaction whilst applying technology
            to several projects has allowed me to enrich young people’s lives.

        My father always says that values come from giving back to the community – that is a
        lifetime goal for me.
